# Kupay Tech Challenge

Hello there, thanks for applying to our engineering positions at Kupay!

We created this challenge in order to learn more about your programming skills applied to the tools we use here at Kupay. 


**Our challenge consists of a CRUD that after being developed must fulfil 5 technical requirements:** 

1. The BE application must have a 4 layers architecture: Router, Business and Database;
2. The FE application must be separate presentation componentes from containers;
3. Test coverage should be more than 80% via Jest both on BE and FE;
4. Payment data should encrypted before saving it to the database: you should use the AES-256 standard, relying on any lib you want.
5. The application must be implemented by using our favorite stack: NodeJS + ExpressJs + Typescript in the **BE** and React, TSX, SCSS in the **FE**. 


**Now, here come our functional requirements:**

We want you develop a web-app that allows customers to create wallet accounts at **Kupay Smart Wallet SA.**

1. The customer will be able to register providing the following info: Name, Email, Debit / Credit Card, and Password;
2. The customer will be able to see a list of avaiable products in the platform with name and price;
3. The customer will be able to buy a product and receive a cashback of 0,01% of every transaction, which will be added to his wallet.
4. The customer will be able to see their transactions with their dates, descriptions and amount.
